# House_prediction
  <ul><li>In this project we have predicted the price of houses accroding to their sizes , number of rooms, bathrooms , location provided by the customer.We also used imputation technique to fill the null values present in the dataset.</li>
      <li>In this we have divided our project into three steps:-
        <ol><li>First step is EDA through which we visualised our data.</li>
          <li>In second step we worked on removing the outliers for better prediction.</li>
          <li>In the last part of our project we trained our model. </li></ol></li>
